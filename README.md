## Kubernetes
An AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service Cluster is created using eksctl and kubectl tools having granted the required iam permissions.
Managed node groups are also spinned up inside the cluster which will allow for the automatic creation of ec2 instances that provisions compute capacity for our application.

* To verify Kubernetes pods are deployed properly
